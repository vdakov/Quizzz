# Code of Conduct

 
## Assignment description:

* The goal of this assignment is to learn how to collaborate together in a programming setting, so we are capable of finishing the designated project, which should prepare us for later programming projects. The * product we wish to deliver is a game that will allow players to learn about energy consumption by doing quizzes on this topic. We wish for the game to be fast paced and  have many other exciting features.  

## Target or ambition level:

* We wish for our game to stand out from the others. The way in which we are hoping to achieve these is through design, completeness of the game (including all the client’s desired features) and adding new unique features. We are working to get a grade of 8.5.


## Products:
What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

Our goal is to deliver a functional quiz game on the topic of energy consumption. We’ll be delivering the game on the GitLab repository. We aim for the GitLab repository to contain all the documents of the game and the agenda’s of all the team meetings in order for the process of the development of the game tobe able to be easily assessed.
We aim for the game to follow industry standards as closely as possible. Also the goals we decided on as a team are to produce a game with a simplistic sleek design and to make a game with very good multiplayer capability.

## Planning:

To ensure quality and timeliness, there will be regular meetings every week, one supervised by the TA and one independently scheduled. More will be scheduled if needed.
We split based on one main factor, time, we aim for all team members to have invested around the same amount of time into the project. A secondary thing we take into account are the talents of each team member, however we do not make these a main factor as all members must work on certain aspects of the project whether or not it is their preferred task.
Personal deadlines will be set one day in advance of the official deadline. We wish to do our deadlines in this way, because we want to prevent not meeting official deadlines due to last minute problems

## Behavior:

 ### When a disagreement arises the group will try to find the reason for it.
* If it is based on decisions for the implementations of the game we’ll make the decision through a majority vote.
* If it is based on the contribution of a team member in a project we’ll asses whether the problem is valid and we’ll suggest the team member whose involvement is not satisfactory to change their behavior so that they follow the Code of Conduct
* If the disagreement is based was caused on a different  reason then we’ll try to find a proper solution for the problem
* If there are still disagreements after we tried to solve the problem then unsatisfied team members are allowed to ask for the chairman for the next meeting with the TA to include time in the Agenda for solving the conflict. If solutioning of the problem is urgent then we’ll contact the TA through Mattermost
* We hope that the TA will be able to assess the validity of the issues causing the conflict and we’ll be able to suggest possible ways in which the team could solve the problem
### We should treat each other with respect.
### You shouldn’t be late without a reason.
### You shouldn’t alter someone’s code without letting them know in advance
### Always responsibly check someone’s code before approving it on GitLab 

## Communication:
* We use Discord to communicate with each other and Mattermost to discuss with the teaching assistant.

## Commitment:

* Each merge request is approved by 2 others ( check if the code is  meaningful etc. )
* The commitment of the chairperson will be evaluated based on them doing their tasks: making the agenda and holding the meeting.
* The commitment of the note takers will  be measured based on the completeness of their notes.
* We are fine with each chair person having as many agenda pots as they find necessary as long as all topics are covered. 
* Test coverage for each class above 60% or more
* Constant meetings and project reviews to find out what needs improvement
* Based on the tip/top evaluation after every meeting, we will measure their commitment

## Meetings:

* We will meet 2-3 times per week
* We add meetings to our program whenever a person makes a request for one and 3 other people approve that the meeting is necessary.
* We cancel  a meeting if 3 people can no longer attend and we reschedule.
* We decide when and where the meeting takes place by going with the majority
* The chairperson should prepare an agenda before the meeting so everyone has an understanding of what will be discussed

## Decision-making:

* We expect everyone to comply after a decision has been made. If there are disagreements before making the final decision, we try to reach a consensus, but are ready to do a majority vote in case of major disagreement.

## Dealing with conflicts:

* We try to reach a consensus whenever possible, if not, we would do a majority vote or ask our teaching assistant for help in resolving the conflict.

## Merge Request Policy

* Every merge request should be reviewed by at least one person at latest 24 hours after the creation of the request. 
* Accordingly, whenever a merge request is made, the one making it should inform the team by channels outside of Gitlab, such as Discord or Mattermost
* If the merge request is not approved, the one blocking it should explain it
* Merge request should not be approved without any feedback. In the case when there are no complaints or questions about a person's code, the reviewer should specify that in their comment
* The one making the merge request should put a short description of all the changes in their merge request. If there are stuff still to be added at a later date, the reviewer should describe what
with "TO-DO" with a time limit they set for doing so with another merge request. 
* When addressing TO-DO parts of a previous merge request in another, they should refer to that merge request explicitly in their comments
* If there is a known bug in the merge request, which is to be fixed, it should be denoted with the "BUG" annotation and fixed as fast as possible. It should additionally be avoided to submit
merge request with bugs unless the one submitting it feels it is absolutely necessary
* The issues that reviewers mention in their comments should be at least addressed in 12 hours from the time of the comment (excluding the hours between 22:00 and 09:00 the next day to account for sleep )
* **This policy applies for new merge requests only and old ones will not be sanctioned since it is not part of the initial Code of Conduct**

## Code Help

* The team has a dedicated channel on their private Discord server name "#code-help", which can be used when a team member is struggling. Team members can write in the chat about code problems, suggestions
and various other cases that they deem fit. 
* Other team members should reply in that chat to the best of their abillity. It is highly encouraged to reply when you can or cannot help in that chat to the person asking the questions and not just ignore the question.
* Members are able to ask questions at any time of the week and at worst they should get a reply within two days to account for rest days such as Saturday and Sunday

## Guidance:

*We expect general help in the process, helping with our organization on deadlines and project work. Whenever applicable, we would also like to be able to ask for technical help and feedback on code quality and teamwork.

## In case the code of conduct is broken:

* We will have a talk with each other to understand the situation but if it repeats we will notify the teaching assistant to decide on the appropriate consequences. 

### Consequences:
* Bring something sweet for the team to share
* Read again the Code of Conduct
* Reflect on the effects of not following the rules the team decided on
* Another team member will have to check for a week that the team member who did not follow the rules previously will not divert from the rules again.
* Receive a warning for the first the first offense that does not follow the code of conduct

## Success factors:

* The team is very collaborative and willing to work together on any issues that may come it
