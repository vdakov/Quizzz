# Things to be done
* Username text field is in both at main screen and server browser, and one should be removed.
* In the question screen, the question text is sometimes being too small to read.
* Joining server is not working properly for more than 2 people. Also, occasionally, game doesn't start from question 1.
* Create button to go back to home screen
* Transition scene in between the questions (showing answer scene) should take few more seconds, and the answer shouldn't pop up directly after the users' answer selection
