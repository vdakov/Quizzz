## Notes from meeting

    * Notes 1:


        Backlog
        Add more “basic” info like how the game actually works
        Change requirements to “As a … I must/should/could/wont…”
        Functional and non-functional requirements should be split into separate lists, non-functional doesn’t need to use MSCW
        No X, decide on an amount

        Things to change
        (I had stuff here but most of it is in google docs already)

        Gitlab issues
        Every requirement should be turned into an issue with a short title and a more elaborate description that includes the user story
        Use labels:
        Must/should/could
        High/med/low priority
        Figure out blocking and linking issues
        Non-functional requirements should not be issues

        Code of conduct
        Split answers given into separate concrete rules
        Clarify on general consequence for breaking rules as well as specific ones for specific rules where appropriate
        “Only allowed to be late/miss deadline X times” etc

        Deadline for HCI draft is next week, final version in W4
        Todo: turn backlog into issues before friday, work on assignment 2B

## Tips-and-tops Meeting 2.1

* No specific Tip-Tops towards any specific team member this week, since there have been not enough opportunities to see how each team
member works
 
* Teamwide Tip-Tops:
    
    * Tip: Divide work more separately instead of each of us working on one task together, schedule meetings more in advance
    * Top: Great work ethic for the team, assignments are on track and on time. Everybody has a desire to work and is contributing towards
    the team's success
