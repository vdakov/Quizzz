# QUIZZZZ

## Description of project

"Quizzzz" is a dynamic multiplayer game that tests its players on their knowledge on energy
consumption by asking them about the costs (in wH) of different activities and to
compare them with one another. The game is fast paced and offers two modes- singleplayer
and multiplayer. Pressure by a timer, players need to answer questions and complete against one
another. The game offers a server browser so users can easily play with their
friends and see how they stack against them in the leaderboards for both multi and single-player.
The game offers a dynamic database, where both users and admins can contribute and edit activites
that will later be used in the game. To make the game more interesting, there
are jokers that spice questions up, different types of questions and emoji for players
to communicate with each other.

## How to run it

###Server
-One needs to download both the activity bank - a JSON File containing the starting
database and the pictures related to it.
-Both of them can be found on the following links:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aqCGSVd5VkHiph4eaiZdTSQdbJUr78My?usp=sharing

!!!For the server to run, the "activities.json" file needs to be put on the
resources folder with that name and the "activity-bank-pictures" folder needs to be put
there as well!!!

WAIT FOR SERVER TO PROPERLY START FOR 20-30 SECONDS!!!

###Client

-The client needs to download the client file along with the commons and run it while
a server is active
- If a client wishes to connect to a different server address than
the default one, they need to change the IP themselvesd
